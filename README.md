# About the Memory Game
This is a project for the Front End NanoDegree at Udacity under the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship (2017-2018, Europe). 

I mostly built the game with Vanilla JavaScript, manipulating the DOM and barely touching the HTML and the CSS. 
All the functionality was created by me except the shuffle function provided by Udacity.
